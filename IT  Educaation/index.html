                As a full stack Python developer, you will be responsible for developing and implementing web
                applications that are scalable, robust, and easy to maintain. You will use a variety of tools,
                frameworks, and libraries to build dynamic web pages, handle user input, and interact with
                databases.Database management involves creating and managing databases that store and retrieve
                application data. As a full stack Python developer, you will work with SQL and NoSQL databases like
                MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis.
